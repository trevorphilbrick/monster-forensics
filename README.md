## About

This app was built is divided up into a front-end and back-end. The front-end is built in React using Vite. The back-end is built using Convex's Backend as a service. Convex made writing http endpoints easy with their HTTP functions. I used Tailwind to help style the UI quickly. After filling out the questionnaire, the answers are submitted to convex via an HTTP function which uses OpenAI's Dall-e to generate images of monsters and serve them to the end user.
